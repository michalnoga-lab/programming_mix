# Maps

Prepare a collection of 20 integers without the repetitions you draw from the range <10, 30>. Then generate a map based on the collection,
the key of which will be the next drawn number, and the value sum of even digits of that number. Determine the pair with the largest from the map values. 
Find the largest and smallest key value. Sort map descending by key / value ratio.
