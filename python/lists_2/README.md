# Lists

Write a program in which you randomize a list of n integers. The value of the variable n and the collection elements are randomly selected from the interval <10,100>. 
Then implement a new list in which from the generated earlier list, you will only put elements that are numbers from the first. Finally, create a subtitle list. Subtitle list item on
the i-th position is formed as a verbal representation the largest digit of the i-th element of the prime number list. For example if in the list of primes we have the number 31, then its verbal
the representation in the subtitle list is THREE because 3 is the largest digit of number 31. Save the received subtitle list to a text file o name of your choice.
