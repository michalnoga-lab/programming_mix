# Lists

Write a program in which you download text placed in a file to the list. Then save the items from the file to a list that contains only capital letters separated by at most one space character. 
Next sort list in descending order by the number of vowels in each string. At the end print a sorted list, first removing items from it, which length does not exceed the number of characters specified by the user.
