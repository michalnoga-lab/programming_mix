I have been working in IT for years, but not as developer. About one year ago I got several programming tasks - biggest
and most important one was creating web tools for our workers internal use, and I loved to code! Since then I try to code as
much as I can. I take part in coding games like checkio and others. Now I want to focus on applications development. I
might not have a big experience, but for me, coding is not work but fun. Let me join Your team and code!
